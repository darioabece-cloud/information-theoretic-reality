# Information-Theoretic Reality Framework

A theoretical framework proposing that reality fundamentally consists of information relationships rather than material substances, with physical laws emerging as consistency requirements for self-observing information patterns.

## Overview

This framework explores four interconnected themes:

1. **Reality as Computation**: Physical laws emerge from minimal information axioms
2. **Universal Fractal Dimensions**: Complex systems optimize at D_f ≈ d - 0.5
3. **Consciousness as Boundary**: Experience emerges at information boundaries
4. **Branch Dynamics**: Observation selects self-consistent computational paths

## Key Predictions

### Testable Near-term
- Quantum error correction bound: Fidelity ≤ 1 - κ(ℏc/E·L)(1/τ)
- Fractal dimensions: D_f ≈ d - 0.5 for information-optimizing systems
- Anesthesia transitions: β ≈ 1/2 scaling near critical dose

### Exploratory
- Quantum measurement bias: P_observed/P_Born = 1 + β·∂O/∂θ
- Memory artifacts from branch mergers
- Enhanced convergent evolution

## Status

- **Mathematical Framework**: Conjectural, derivations incomplete
- **Empirical Validation**: Pending
- **Purpose**: Generate testable hypotheses from philosophical principles
