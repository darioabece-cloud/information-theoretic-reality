# Information-Theoretic Reality Framework

A theoretical framework proposing that reality fundamentally consists of information relationships rather than material substances.

## Core Papers

1. **Overview: An Information-Theoretic View of Reality** - Accessible introduction to the framework
2. **Reality as Computation** - Deriving physics from information axioms
3. **Universal Fractal Dimensions** - Information optimization in physical systems  
4. **Emergence of Experience** - How information boundaries create consciousness
5. **Branch Dynamics** - Self-consistency and observation in computational reality 

## Key Predictions

- Quantum error correction bounds: Fidelity ≤ 1 - κ(ℏc/E·L)(1/τ)
- Fractal dimensions: D_f ≈ d - 0.5 for information-optimizing systems
- Consciousness measure: Ψ_c = Φ · C · exp(-‖Ḃ‖/ε)
- Quantum measurement bias: P_observed/P_Born = 1 + β·∂O/∂θ

## Status

This is a theoretical framework with testable predictions. Mathematical derivations are partially complete; experimental validation is pending.
