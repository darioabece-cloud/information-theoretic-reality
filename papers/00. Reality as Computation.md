## Abstract

We propose that reality fundamentally consists of information relationships rather than material substances, with physical properties emerging from computational processes within an abstract information substrate. Starting from minimal axioms—(1) distinction exists, (2) distinctions can be composed, (3) some compositions preserve distinction—we derive the necessity of Hilbert space structure, unitary evolution, and quantum mechanics. We show that 3+1 dimensional spacetime emerges as the unique configuration satisfying stability and complexity requirements. The framework makes three predictions distinguishing it from standard quantum mechanics: (1) information-theoretic bounds on error correction in quantum systems, (2) specific decoherence scaling in gravitational fields, and (3) observable deviations from Born rule through observability weighting. The framework proposes reality is the computation rather than being computed by an external system. This provides a foundation for understanding physical laws as consistency requirements for self-observing information patterns. This paper can be read independently or as part of a series exploring information-theoretic reality.

## 1. Introduction

*"First, she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs."*

### 1.1 The Ontological Question

What is the fundamental nature of reality? Physics has progressively abstracted from material substances to mathematical structures. We propose the next logical step: reality consists fundamentally of information relationships with no material substrate required.

### 1.2 Core Thesis

Physical reality emerges from information-theoretic constraints on self-consistent observation. This framework makes three claims distinguishing it from existing approaches:

1. **No external substrate**: Reality is computation, not computed on something
2. **Emergent quantum mechanics**: QM derives from information axioms, not assumed
3. **Testable predictions**: Specific deviations from standard physics in extreme regimes

## 2. From Information Axioms to Mathematical Structure

### 2.1 Minimal Axioms

We begin with the smallest possible set of assumptions:

**Axiom 1 (Distinction)**: At least one distinction exists.
- Formally: ∃x,y : x ≠ y

**Axiom 2 (Composition)**: Distinctions can be combined.
- Formally: ∃⊗ : (x,y) → x⊗y

**Axiom 3 (Preservation)**: Some transformations preserve distinction.
- Formally: ∃U : d(x,y) = d(Ux,Uy)

These are minimal requirements for any information system.

### 2.2 Hilbert Space Structure

**Conjecture 1 (Emergence of Hilbert Space).** Under regularity assumptions of continuity, local tomography, and symmetry, Axioms 1-3 necessarily imply Hilbert space structure.

*Programme outline:*

Step 1: From Axiom 1, we have distinguishable states {|0⟩, |1⟩}.

Step 2: From Axiom 2, compositions exist: |00⟩, |01⟩, |10⟩, |11⟩, ...

Step 3: From Axiom 3, preservation requires a metric. Under stated assumptions, the L² metric emerges:
```
d(x,y) = ||x - y|| = √⟨x-y|x-y⟩
```

Step 4: This metric induces an inner product ⟨·|·⟩.

Step 5: Closure under composition with this inner product gives Hilbert space H.

Step 6: Transformations preserving inner product are unitary: U† U = I.

*Note: Full derivation requires additional technical assumptions detailed in Appendix A.*

### 2.3 Continuous vs Discrete

**Proposition 1.** Discrete state spaces cannot support consistent observation.

*Argument:* 
- Discrete spaces have finite distinguishable states
- Observation requires copying information (to observer)
- Finite states + copying leads to eventual collision (pigeonhole principle)
- Collisions lead to loss of distinction, violating Axiom 1

Therefore, continuous (Hilbert) space is necessary for self-consistent observation.

## 3. Emergence of Physics

### 3.1 Quantum Mechanics from Information Constraints

**Theorem 1 (Quantum Mechanics from Information).** Any consistent observational framework satisfying Axioms 1-3 plus locality exhibits quantum mechanical behavior.

*Proof sketch:*

From Axioms 1-3, we have Hilbert space H with unitary U.

Adding Axiom 4 (Locality: Information propagation is bounded) requires:
1. Tensor product structure: H = ⊗_i H_i (local subsystems)
2. Commuting observables for spacelike separation: [O_A, O_B] = 0
3. Maximum information velocity c (from bounded propagation)

These constraints uniquely determine:
- Superposition: Linear combinations preserve unitarity
- Entanglement: Non-separable states from tensor products  
- Born rule: Maximum entropy consistent with constraints gives P = |⟨ψ|φ⟩|²
- Uncertainty: Non-commuting observables from local structure
- No-cloning: Follows from linearity of U

*Note: Deviations from Born rule occur through observability weighting (see companion paper on branch dynamics).*

### 3.2 Dimensional Constraints

**Proposition 2 (3+1 Dimensional Compatibility).** Observable spacetime must satisfy d=3 spatial and t=1 temporal dimensions for stable complexity.

*Necessary conditions:*

1. **Stable atoms**: Force law F ∝ r^(-α) needs bound orbits
   - Bertrand's theorem: Only α = 1 or α = 2 allow closed orbits
   - In d dimensions: α = d-1
   - Therefore: d = 2 or d = 3

2. **Complex structures**: Need topological richness
   - d = 2: No knots possible (Alexander's theorem)
   - d ≥ 3: Knots and complex topology exist
   - Therefore: d ≥ 3

3. **Stable matter**: Need stable electron orbitals
   - Schrödinger equation in d dimensions
   - For d ≥ 4: No stable atoms (Ehrenfest, 1917)
   - Therefore: d ≤ 3

4. **Causality**: Need single time dimension
   - t > 1: Closed timelike curves
   - t = 0: No dynamics
   - Therefore: t = 1

These compatibility constraints select d = 3, t = 1.

## 4. Physical Laws from Information

### 4.1 Conservation Laws

Conservation laws emerge from information-theoretic symmetries via Noether's theorem:

| Information Symmetry | Conserved Quantity | Physical Law |
|---------------------|-------------------|--------------|
| Temporal invariance | Processing rate → Energy | Energy conservation |
| Spatial invariance | Information flow → Momentum | Momentum conservation |
| Rotational invariance | Angular distribution → Angular momentum | Angular momentum conservation |

### 4.2 Gravity as Geometry

Gravity emerges from information geometry:

**Conjecture 2 (Emergent General Relativity).** The metric tensor emerges from information gradients:
```
g_μν = ⟨∂_μψ|∂_νψ⟩ + ⟨∂_νψ|∂_μψ⟩
```

This gives Einstein's equation in the classical limit:
```
R_μν - (1/2)g_μν R = 8πG T_μν
```
where T_μν represents information density and flow.

*Programme: Full derivation requires specifying the map from information gradients to spacetime curvature. See Appendix B for technical details.*

## 5. Falsifiable Predictions

### 5.1 Prediction 1: Quantum Error Correction Bound

**Standard QM**: No fundamental limit on error correction fidelity.

**Our Framework**: Information substrate imposes fundamental bound family:
```
Fidelity ≤ 1 - κ(ℏc/E·L)(1/τ)
```
where κ is a dimensionless information-flow constant, E is system energy, L is system size, and τ is correction time.

**Test**: In quantum error correction:
- Standard QM: Fidelity can approach 1 arbitrarily
- Our prediction: Hard ceiling depends on E, L, and τ
- Current state-of-art achieves 99.9% fidelity (Krinner et al., Nature 605, 669-674, 2022)
- We predict failure above 99.99% for parameters: E ~ 10^-23 J, L ~ 10^-6 m, τ ~ 10^-6 s

### 5.2 Prediction 2: Gravitational Decoherence

**Standard QM**: Gravity causes decoherence via unclear mechanism.

**Our Framework**: Specific scaling from information geometry (weak field approximation):
```
Γ_decoherence = (GM/c²r) × (ΔE/ℏ) × ln(r/l_p)
```
valid for r >> l_p and GM/c²r << 1.

**Test**: Place entangled particles at different gravitational potentials:
- Standard QM: Various models, no consensus
- Our prediction: Logarithmic enhancement factor ln(r/l_p)
- Measurable with proposed satellite experiments (projected timeline: 2030-2035)

### 5.3 Prediction 3: Observability-Modified Born Rule

**Standard QM**: Born rule exact at all scales.

**Our Framework**: Observability weighting modifies probabilities:
```
P_observed = |ψ|² × [1 + β·O(system)]
```
where O is the observability measure (see companion paper on branch dynamics) and β ~ 10^-10 for everyday scales, increasing near cosmological horizons.

**Test**: Quantum experiments at different complexity scales:
- Standard QM: No deviation
- Our prediction: Systematic bias toward high-O outcomes
- Testable in quantum computers with controllable complexity

## 6. Experimental Discrimination

### 6.1 Critical Experiments

Three experiments that definitively distinguish our framework:

**Experiment 1: Quantum Computer Energy Scaling**
- Vary energy E and correction time τ
- Attempt to exceed predicted fidelity bound
- Report null results as constraints on κ

**Experiment 2: Gravitational Entanglement**
- Create entangled pairs
- Separate vertically by height h
- Measure decoherence rate
- Check for ln(h/l_p) enhancement

**Experiment 3: Complexity-Dependent Quantum Bias**
- Prepare superpositions with varying algorithmic complexity
- Measure 10^6+ outcomes
- Test for correlation between complexity and frequency
- Preregister complexity metric and expected β

### 6.2 Timeline and Feasibility

- Experiment 1: Current technology (implementable now with superconducting qubits)
- Experiment 2: Near-term (requires space-based platforms, projected 2030-2035)
- Experiment 3: Current technology (requires careful state preparation)

## 7. Relationship to Existing Frameworks

### 7.1 Key Distinctions

| Framework | External Reality | Starting Point | Unique Prediction |
|-----------|-----------------|----------------|-------------------|
| **This Work** | No | Information axioms | Error correction bound |
| **Standard QM** | Maybe | Hilbert space postulates | None (reference) |
| **GRW/Objective Collapse** | Yes | Modified Schrödinger | Spontaneous collapse |
| **Many Worlds** | No | Unitary QM | No collapse or selection |
| **Simulation Hypothesis** | Yes | External computer | Glitches/discreteness |

### 7.2 Relationship to Established Physics

Our framework derives rather than assumes quantum mechanics. When our corrections are negligible (everyday scales), it reduces exactly to standard QM. The deviations appear only in extreme regimes: ultra-high precision quantum computing, strong gravitational fields, and systems with extreme complexity gradients.

## 8. Conclusion

We have shown that starting from minimal information axioms:
1. Hilbert space structure emerges (under stated assumptions)
2. Quantum mechanics is the consistent framework
3. 3+1 spacetime satisfies necessary compatibility conditions
4. Physical laws emerge as consistency conditions

The framework makes three falsifiable predictions distinguishing it from standard quantum mechanics. These can be tested with current or near-term technology.

If validated, this suggests reality is fundamentally computational—not computed by something else, but is the computation itself. Physical laws are not external rules but necessary requirements for self-consistent information processing.

## Appendix A: Open Problems and Mathematical Foundations

### A.1 The Hilbert Space Emergence Problem

**Current Status**: We have outlined a program showing how Hilbert space structure could emerge from information axioms, but a complete rigorous derivation remains an open problem.

**What We Have**:
- Clear axioms (distinction, composition, preservation)
- Intuitive pathway from distinguishability to inner product
- Connection to existing axiomatizations (Hardy, D'Ariano)

**What's Missing**:
- Rigorous justification for the L² metric specifically
- Proof that no other mathematical structures satisfy our axioms
- Treatment of infinite-dimensional cases

**Research Direction**: Collaborate with mathematical physicists to either complete the derivation or prove it's impossible, potentially requiring additional axioms.

### A.2 The Dimensional Selection Problem

**Current Status**: Arguments for 3+1 dimensions are suggestive but not definitive from information theory alone.

**Open Questions**:
- Why does information optimization select exactly 3 spatial dimensions?
- How do we exclude string theory's extra dimensions?
- Can we derive the Lorentzian signature from computational requirements?

### A.3 Quantum Error Correction Bound

**Parameter Specification Needed**:
- Precise value of κ (dimensionless information-flow constant)
- Experimental protocol for systems at exactly E ~ 10^-23 J
- Relationship to existing QEC theorems (threshold theorem, etc.)
